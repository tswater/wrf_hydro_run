1) 	Install help2man (follow instructions in INSTALL/README)
2)	Install m4 (follow instructions in INSTALL/README)
3)	Install zlib (follow instructions in INSTALL/README)
4)	Install curl (follow instructions in INSTALL/README)
5)	!!(may have done this step earlier or later)!! 
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:home/…/software/lib
	export PATH=$PATH:home/…/software/bin
	export PATH=$PATH:home/…/software/include
6)	Install HDF (follow instructions in INSTALL/README)
7)	Install netCDF for C (follow instructions in install/readme)
	make sure that CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS are assigned in same line as configure
8)	Install netCDF for Fortran (follow instructions in install/readme)
	may need to define FC=/…/gfortran     as well as  F77=/…/gfortran
9)	Now add WRF: https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/OnLineTutorial/compilation_tutorial.php 
	a)	Compiled with dmpar, gfortran. NoahMP. 
		whenever given an option did the default 
	b)	Compiled em_real case (3D real)
	c)	I had issue in compilation where the log.compile was full of ERROR 127
		and things about no such command in reference to the ‘time’ command. 
		This was fixed by opening configure.wrf and changing the line 
		FC  = time (stuff) to FC = (stuff)
	d)	I had an issue with WPS not finding WRF. I changed the name of the WRF
		folder from WRF-4.1.3 to WRF and the error was fixed
	e)	I chose to compile WPS in serial, since this was “highly recommended” 
		in the instructions
10)	At this point I realize that this got WRF up and running but not WRF Hydro 
	standalone so that is interesting, but I guess I now have WRF compiled. So now 
	I went back and compiled WRF hydro in standalone with no issues: 
	https://ral.ucar.edu/sites/default/files/public/HowToBuildandRunWRF-HydroV5inStandaloneMode.pdf
11)	After this, follow the istructions in the README.txt here. You may want to
	move the wrf_hydro.exe file here for an updated compile, as well as namelists
	and .TBL files in tables.
