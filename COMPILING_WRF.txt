1) 	Install help2man (follow instructions in INSTALL/README)
2)	Install m4 (follow instructions in INSTALL/README)
3)	Install zlib (follow instructions in INSTALL/README)
4)	Install curl (follow instructions in INSTALL/README)
5)	!!(may have done this step earlier or later)!! 
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:home/…/software/lib
	export PATH=$PATH:home/…/software/bin
	export PATH=$PATH:home/…/software/include
6)	Install HDF (follow instructions in INSTALL/README)
7)	Install netCDF for C (follow instructions in install/readme)
	make sure that CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS are assigned in same line as configure
8)	Install netCDF for Fortran (follow instructions in install/readme)
	may need to define FC=/…/gfortran     as well as  F77=/…/gfortran
9)	If you have not already done so, add openmpi*/bin (NOT mpich) on the cluster to path
10)	Now add WRF: https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/OnLineTutorial/compilation_tutorial.php 
	a)	Compiled with dmpar, gfortran. NoahMP. 
		whenever given an option did the default 
	b)	Compiled em_real case (3D real)
	c)	I had issue in compilation where the log.compile was full of ERROR 127
		and things about no such command in reference to the ‘time’ command. 
		This was fixed by opening configure.wrf and changing the line 
		FC  = time (stuff) to FC = (stuff)
	d)	I had an issue with WPS not finding WRF. I changed the name of the WRF
		folder from WRF-4.1.3 to WRF and the error was fixed
	e)	I chose to compile WPS in serial, since this was “highly recommended” 
		in the instructions
10)	Continue with compiling wrf_hydro standalone; follow the listed instructions
11)	After this, follow the istructions in the README.txt here. You may want to
	move the wrf_hydro.exe file from wrf_hydro compilation here for an updated compile,
	as well as namelists and .TBL files in tables. Although, there is no gaurantee that
	the updated version of wrf hydro will work. Currently, these scripts are meant for
	WRF HYDRO 5.1.1
